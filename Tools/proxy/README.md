This sub-project provides a simple Ant task that serves the Cesium source directory locally for development, using [Jetty](http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/).  It also provides example functionality that proxies web requests that don't yet support Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), and also transcodes terrain data into a format usable by web browsers.
